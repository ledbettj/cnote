1. INTRODUCTION

cnote is a configurable notification daemon which adheres to the Desktop 
Notifications Specification [people.gnome.org/~mccann/docs/notification-spec].

cnote is free software, released under the GNU GPL; see the LICENSE file for 
details.

2. REQUIRED 

cnote depends on the following python modules:
   * python-cairo
   * python-gtk2
   * python-dbus
   * python-simplejson
   * python-xdg

3. BUILDING

To build cnote, you will additionally need:
   * python-dev
   * python-cairo-dev
   * python-setuptools

The only thing that needs to be built is the included C module:
   * cd cnote-git/cnote/cairo_blur && make

4. USING

'python ./cnote-daemon.py' is sufficient to start cnote.  pass '--help' to list
 additional useful options.

If you want to make cnote the default notification service, you can do the
following (pending an actual installation script/tool):
  * copy any themes to somewhere cnote should find them, such as 
    /usr/local/share/cnote/themes/ or ~/.local/share/cnote/themes/
  * edit /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notification.services
    to launch cnote:
    Exec=/your/path/to/cnote-daemon.py

5. THEMES

themes for cnote are json files ending with '.cnote-theme'.  Themes can modify
a notification's appearance in many ways, including colors, text style, size,
and location.  See the existing themes in the 'theme' directory for details.
